\begin{problem}
    A friend wants you to help them build a deck. Which of the below would you consider to be \textbf{extraneous} information when deciding if you should help? (Select all that apply)
    \begin{selectAll}
        \choice{How long will the deck take to build?}
        \choice{How many other people will be involved?}
        \choice[correct]{What color is the deck?}
        \choice[correct]{Is the deck on the front or rear of the house?}
        \choice{Is the deck being built at his house (ie nearby) or somewhere else?}
    \end{selectAll}
    \begin{problem}
        After further discussion you discover your friend is really terrible at planning and needs help figuring out the cost of the deck. Which of the following questions might you ask to help him figure that out? (Select all that apply)
        \begin{selectAll}
            \choice[correct]{What are the specific dimensions of the deck?}
            \choice[correct]{What kind of wood does your friend want to make the deck from?}
            \choice{What color paint do they want?}
            \choice[correct]{Does your friend actually want to paint the deck?}
            \choice{What time of day will the construction occur?}
        \end{selectAll}
        \begin{problem}
            Finally, after a lot of back and forth, you and your friend calculate that the cost to build the deck will be \$$4$ per square foot of space. Your friend wants to make a twenty by fifteen foot deck, how much would it cost? $\answer{1200}$
